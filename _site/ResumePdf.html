<p class="text">
I am a generalist programmer with broad interests and a special passion for art and entertainment. I've been more recently involved in hardware prototyping, makerspaces and CG/CV. My current goal is to work on multidisciplinary tech research, be it in Academia or private sector.
<br />
I have experience in multiple areas, ranging from state budget to Computer Vision art installations. I love the enormous variety of problems that can be solved with Computer Science and relish new challenges and learning things from scratch.

<p>I investigated ways to improve on the <a href="https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/fabscan" target="_blank">FabScan</a> 3D Scanner so it could run with multiple cameras, multiple laserbeams and auto-calibration with fiducial markers, giving the user the possibility to adjust the layout according to the shape of the scanned object. The code was in <span class="skill">Python</span>.</p>

<p>I was also the developer and main creator of the <a href="/InvisibleWall">Invisible Wall</a>, an interactive art instalation for a 2016 Arts and Technology Festival by <a href="http://www.incubadoradeartistas.com.br/">Incubadora de Artistas</a>, coded in <span class="skill">C</span>/<span class="skill">C++</span>.</p>

<p>I was also the sole programmer responsible for coding two projects for <a target="_blank" href="http://redeglobo.globo.com/">Rede Globo</a>, the largest brazilian TV network.<br />
The first one was <a href="/MarkerFinder">MarkerFinder</a>, which aimed to make the process of mapping fiducial markers on a studio’s ceiling automatic. This map of markers is used to calculate a camera’s position in the studio, making it possible to superimpose graphical effects with precision. It’s coded in <span class="skill">C++</span> using <a href="http://opencv.org/" target="_blank">OpenCV</a>.<br />
The second deals with loading video frames to GPU, for faster image processing. It was written in <span class="skill">C</span>.</p>

<p>As a Trainee I dealt mainly with a product for market segmentation and selection. The customers were usually large companies with big client databases. StoneAge’s product could segment these kinds of databases very quickly, showing how many people were in each segment. The company could then decide to launch a marketing campaign for a very specific target audience. My role in this was understanding the customers’ needs and implementing the processes so they could use this product.

<p>The concept was created by the <a href="/employerOHMS">OHMS</a> team and I. It was coded by me in <span class="skill">C</span>/<span class="skill">C++</span>, with <span class="skill">OpenCV</span>.</p>

<p>This installation consists in a light-controlled room with a camera pointing to the participants and projecting their silhouettes on the wall in front of them. These silhouettes are filled with the view from the other side of the projection wall, captured by another camera. The wall becomes “invisible” only inside each person’s contours, making them move around to interact with the other side.

This project’s goal was to make the mapping of fiducial markers on a studio’s ceiling automatic. This mapping process is a crucial preparation step for the use of <a href="http://www.lightcrafttech.com/" target="_blank">LightCraft</a> Technology. LightCraft uses an extra wide-angle lens equipped to the top of a camera, pointing up to a ceiling covered with fiducial markers. This lens captures the location of these markers and, with a previously known map, calculates the camera’s location within the studio. The superimposition of virtual elements over the footage is considerably easier when this location is known. Before <b>MarkerFinder</b>, this mapping was done manually and took about 4 hours. Now, it takes 20 to 40 minutes.<!--more--> Since this was made for a brazilian company, it is documented in Portuguese.<br />

            <p>Inspired by the raging bull that was driving the real estate prices in Rio de Janeiro to the sky between 2011-13, this <span class="skill">Python</span> script calculates the optimal down payment on a house.<br />
The user inputs the value of the house; how much money is set aside; the expected interest on such money; monthly disposable income; the annual interest to be paid to the bank and the number of payments.<br />
The script then gives the down payment value that optimizes either total amount of money after all is paid or the average monthly financial impact.</p>

It is a competitive game between hunters - the player and the non playable characters (NPC’s). The hunters score taking preys to the goals. The speed that a hunter moves is a function of its strength and the prey’s weight. The decision making process of an NPC’s take in consideration its strength, the intention of those stronger than him, the surrounding preys’ distances and weights. It implements the well known A* pathfinding algorithm to find the nearest safe goal and avoid obstacles and enemies.<br />
